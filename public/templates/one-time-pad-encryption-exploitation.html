<h2>Procedure</h2>

<p class="solution-text no-indent">
    One-time pad encryption is not perfect. There are a few vulnerabilities associated with it, and in this page we will take a look
    at one type of attack called crib-dragging. The first problem with one-time padding is regarding key misuse. If the encryption
    process uses the same key more than once (two times is enough), an attacker can discover the 
    key and decrypt the ciphertext without much problem. All it's needed for the attacker to succeed is to know the two plain texts that
    the same key was used and one of the ciphertexts (or the two ciphertexts and one
    plain text). At first glance, this seems difficult, but some applications do not protect correctly some of these four components. 
</p>

<p class="solution-text no-indent">
    For example, some applications can display to the user a default plain text in its source code that is used to set a certain 
    pattern for the webpage, such as setting the background color, language or other functionality options. If the source code is
    easily accessible and the attacker sees the default plain text and its ciphertext, it is possible to utilize another plain text
    generated in the user-side (setting background, language...) and check with a tool/software what is the output ciphertext generated. This is 
    enough for the attacker to recover a key and retrieve other sensitive information stored in the website, that might also be encrypted
    with the very same key.
</p>

<p class="solution-text no-indent">
    What is even more scary, if there is no other type of encryption or encoding middleway through, is that by knowing the plain text and the generated ciphertext
    in this example is enough to retrieve the key. That's why there are other encryption happening when one-time padding. Another possibility
    is that the default plain text is not exactly what's being encrypted. Sometimes, the default plain text is just meant to give a simple
    example of how the plain text format should look like, not necessarily meaning that this is what's being used as plain text in the encryption.

<p class="solution-text no-indent">
    Let's see how this works in practice. Here we shall build and exploit a vulnerable one-time pad encryption script.
