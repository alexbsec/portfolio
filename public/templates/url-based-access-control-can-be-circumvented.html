            In this lab, it seems that the developers protected URL POST requests and we need to bypass it by using different headers. To access the lab,
            click <a class="fake-link" target="blank" href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-url-based-access-control-can-be-circumvented">here</a>.
            Aight! Start your BurpSuite, set the target and let's dive in this practioner lab!
        </p>
        <div class="fig-breath">
            <img class="fig-body" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/priv-esc-url-control-circum-1.png')}}">
        </div>
        <p class="solution-text no-indent">
            Ok, the first thing that is really crazy is that in the homepage we have a link Admin panel right in front of us. This is funny, but it looks like bait.
            Clicking on it will lead us to a 403: forbidden page. And here I thought this is already solved!
        </p>
        <p class="solution-text no-indent">
            Let's see what we find in BurpSuite after clicking this link. Nothing. We can try to enumerate sub-directories inside the admin page and see if
            we get access. Ok, let's try to log in then. Crap, we actually don't have credentials. Ok, let's login with a wrong users and analyze BurpSuite's 
            requests/responses.
        </p>
        <div class="fig-breath">
            <img class="fig-body" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/priv-esc-url-control-circum-2.png')}}">
        </div>
        <p class="solution-text no-indent">
            As expected, we have wrong credentials. But wait a moment there. The lab tells us that they prevent accessing a certain page through POST requests.
            What if we add a header here, the X-Original-URL one seems a good one. We add "/admin" to see if the header sends us to the admin page even with wrong
            credentials. Let's intercept everything. Capture the login button. Look what we can add to this request:
        </p>
        <div class="fig-breath">
            <img class="fig-body" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/priv-esc-url-control-circum-3.png')}}">
        </div>
        <p class="solution-text no-indent">
            This X-Original-URL header 
        <div class="fig-breath">
            <img class="fig-body" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/priv-esc-url-control-circum-4.png')}}">
        </div>
        <p class="solution-text no-indent">
            It seems we have solved the lab, but when I click on delete, I get a 403 again. '-.-
            This is getting problematic. Through the POST request I was able to circumvent the page and access the admin panel,
            but it seems it does not see me as admin. Intercepting the delete button and adding the X-Original-URL header also does not
            work (at least for me).
        </p>
        <p class="solution-text no-indent">
            After a while scrapping through all requests and breaking my mind to understand what was happening, I had an idea. When I clicked on the delete button,
            it was redirecting me to /admin/delete page. What if we did this process again but directly from the homepage? Well, let's try that.
        </p>
        <div class="fig-breath">
            <img class="fig-body" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/priv-esc-url-control-circum-5.png')}}">
        </div>
        <p class="solution-text no-indent">
            Our response now is a 302! If we go back to the lab, we have solved it. This is really weird, because we could only delete the account by sending 
            requests (this time, a GET request on /). But we could also access the admin panel page through the login page! Such an interesting lab.
