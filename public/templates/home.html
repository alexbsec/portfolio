    <h2 class="section-title">About</h2>

    <p class="solution-text no-indent">I have a bachelor and MSc degree in physics. I always loved to program and I decided to take a step further and learn more about
        penetration tests, WebSecurity, CyberSecurity and ethical hacking.
        
        I am proficient when it comes to programming in Python. Usually, I work in a linux environment to program. Kali Linux is my go to choice for pentests.

        This portfolio page has sign-up and login functionalities. In order to see solutions to PortSwigger labs, you need to be registered and authenticated (or find a way
        to navigate through the website pages. Some pages are vulnerable if accessed directly through the URL. Find your way through). The web application used is a simple sqlachemy database,
        and the routes and authentication are programmed in Python.

        One of my recent interests has been in encryption algorithms, and I have been studying various encryption techniques and protocols to better understand how they can be used to secure data in real-world applications. One of my recent interests has been encryption algorithms. I find the challenge of implementing complex encryption algorithms and ensuring their security to be both fascinating and rewarding.

        When I'm not programming or working on cybersecurity projects, I enjoy reading and writing about science, technology, and philosophy. I believe that it's important to have a broad perspective on the world, and I enjoy exploring different ideas and ways of thinking. I'm also an avid traveler and enjoy exploring new places and cultures. I find that traveling broadens my perspective and helps me to better understand and appreciate different ways of life.
