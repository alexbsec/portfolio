<h1>Portfolio Webpage</h1>

This is my Portfolio webpage that is under development. Here you will
be able to check all my projects, labs, CTFs and even play around with some
web application functionalities present in this webpage (still in progress).

<h2>HOW TO USE/VISUALIZE WEBPAGE PORTFOLIO</h2>
Simply access it at http://hobohacker.pythonanywhere.com

You need to install python 3.7+

Clone repo:

`git clone https://github.com/buschinelli-joao/portfolio`

* Needed packages:
    * flask
    * flask_login
    * flask_sqlalchemy

To run server, use `python main.py` inside portfolio folder. After that, you can navigate pretty easily throughout the webpage.
Sign-up is necessary in order to access all pages.



<h2>Future Updates</h2>
Thinking of implementing a comment session in labs' pages. This feature will need user to be authenticated. Also,
thinking about on how to create some security breaches in order to test pentests skills. Studying a little to do so.

I will add more PortSwigger labs solutions as I solve them. There are a few solutions that is yet not implemented.

About page is blank, need to update that. There is also no reference to projects I've been developing. Will add that
soon.

<h2>As of Feb 4 - 2023</h2>
Right now, the page has little functionalities. Suffixes are already removed. Login, sign-up and
logout functionalities are working. Database is implemented. User can only access labs and other pages
if logged in and authenticated. Simple sign-up form is added.

There are already some apprentice PortSwigger labs with solutions I've found. It looks like a blog
post where I explain my thought process to solve all the problems.

<h2>About</h2>

This portfolio is meant to give an idea of how my skills are progressing as I
continue to study ethical hacking, pentests and cyber security. The idea behind it
is not limited to show these skills, but also to track my evolution process throughout
the time spent learning such skills.

All of my ongoing/finished projects can be seen in my GitHub page, but soon they will
be well described in the portfolio.
