<h1>Portfolio Webpage</h1>

This is my Portfolio webpage that is under development. Here you will
be able to check all my projects, labs, CTFs and even play around with some
web application functionalities present in this webpage (still in progress).


<h2>As of Feb 4 - 2023</h2>
Right now, the page has little functionalities. I'm using Flask to create routes to clean
file suffixes (such as .html, .png and so on). I'm working on the authentication page in order
to implement some security functionalities, and then break them. 

There is already some apprentice PortSwigger labs with solutions I've found. It looks like a blog
post where I explain my thought process to solve all the problems.

<h2>About</h2>

This portfolio is meant to give an idea of how my skills are progressing as I
continue to study ethical hacking, pentests and cyber security. The idea behind it
is not limited to show these skills, but also to track my evolution process throughout
the time spent learning such skills.

All of my ongoing/finished projects can be seen in my GitHub page, but soon they will
be well described in the portfolio.
